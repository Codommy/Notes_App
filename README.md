# Todo_App
A dynamic to-do list application built with React that allows users to toggle between Add Mode and Priority Mode. In Priority Mode, tasks can be assigned a priority (Low, Medium, High), and the list can be auto-ordered or manually reordered based on task priority.

Features:
- Add Mode: Allows users to add new tasks.
- Priority Mode: Tasks are assigned a priority (Low, Medium, High).
- Auto Ordering: Tasks are automatically ordered based on priority (High > Medium > Low).
- Manual Ordering: Users can manually reorder tasks using the "Manual Order" button.
- Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly and works across different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:
- React – User interface and app state management
- CSS – Styling and responsiveness
- Local Storage (optional) – Saving tasks and priorities across sessions

How It Works:
- Toggle between Add Mode and Priority Mode using the mode switch.
- Add tasks in Add Mode and assign them a priority in Priority Mode.
- Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (High, Medium, Low) or can be manually reordered by clicking "Manual Order".
- Edit any task’s text or priority as needed.

Why I Built This:
I created this project to practice my React skills and explore how to implement dynamic task management with real-world functionality, such as priority sorting and manual reordering. This app helped me improve my understanding of state management, conditional rendering, and UI/UX design in React.

Future Improvements:
- Add a "Completed" status for tasks to track progress.
- Enhance styling and add animations for smoother user interactions.
